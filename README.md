## Usage

### Xamarin.iOS

You are welcome to see the sample of the project for fully operating sample in the ContextSideMenu folder. You have to reference ContextSideMenuBinding.dll in your project and add code as sample project.

## Customisation

To customise menu items side position you can specify a 'menuItemsSide' property. When it set to 'Right' the first cell will be opened from right to left and selected cell will be closed vice versa and when it set to 'Left' the first cell will be opened from left to right and selected cell will be closed vice versa. Default - Right. 

To customise cell set up your custom drawables in the animated icon. Actually the cell design and layout is completely at your choice.

animationDuration is to be used for animation speed in seconds.
